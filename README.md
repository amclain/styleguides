# Alex's Coding Style Guides

This repository contains explanations and examples of my preferred coding styles for various programming languages. When contributing to one of my repositories, I expect that the submitted code reasonably conforms to these guidelines. In my opinion style guides aren’t an ultimate authority, they’re recommendations. If a technical issue, precedent in the project, or just plain common sense gives you good reason to deviate from the guidelines at times, that’s ok. Use your best judgement.

If there is a conflict between these guidelines and existing code in a project, try to follow the style of the project. It’s more important that the project presents itself as a consistent piece of work. Most likely this won’t be visible as a written style guide for the project, but in the majority of code already written.
